## Motives & Background
From the beginning,  I created this bot to make it easier for me to get the data of the films that I had watched. 

The First Thing i do is create a **REST API**. I want to assess the films that I have watched and put that value into the database. I want to easily access it in the future. In the same time, I often use Discord to communicate. Especially for communicate with my friends and play with some bot. In Discord the bots is massively used on all servers. Bots are made in different ways, some are very useful to the odd ones. From here I thought to make a discord bot and at the same time completing a portfolio to add some value to my courses. For the First time i do to my bot is see a rate from my movie database at my REST API. After then i create for **CRUD in my bot**. 

But I found something interesting than just making a film database. That is downloading the torrent. I know this illegal, but this is first api for me to study public api. I will that feature in the future. Then I thought about getting the latest **covid-19** data to find out the development of the pandemic in this day.

For the latest features, which are lyrics when listening to spotify, I was inspired to get the lyrics without having to go to the Google web to search for them and use Discord bot to quickly search for the lyrics.

## Project & Duration
I started this project in **March 2020** and it's been running for 4 months at the time of i write this. 

But there were times when I stopped developing the bot because of a lot of things that I was working on. As of the date of i write this documentation, my bot is already in the 55th version according to deployment to cloud hosted on Heroku. With the development details as follows:
* REST API for movie database: 1 Week
* Making Bot: 1 Day
* Accessing rest api and making torrent links: 2-3 Weeks + 2 weeks (There is a change from updates to faster performance. Improvements to make it easier for users)
* Making covid-19 info: 2-3 days + a days (There is a change from updates to faster performance. Improvements to make it easier for users)
* Making spotify lyrics: 2-3 days + a days (There is a change from updates to faster performance. Improvements to make it easier for users. Especially For this i make a major change from musixmatch api to genius api. i will explain this in insight.md) 

### Note
I just guessed but i can be sure this is right. I forgot exactly how much time that i spend.
